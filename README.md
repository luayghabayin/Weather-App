# What languages I used
I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript
# Decription
The app provides a simple yet comprehensive interface that displays current weather conditions, temperature, and current time for any location you enter.  I had to fetch the data from an API to make sure that the information displayed is accurate and up-to-date.

It's lightweight and easy to use, providing accurate weather information for locations all around the world. It's a great way to get a quick glance at the weather before heading out, and also a good way for me to showcase my skills in web development, specifically on how to fetch data from an API. It's a small project but I am proud of what I achieved and I hope you'll find it helpful
# What I learned
A weather app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Fetches data from an API to display accurate weather information which required me to understand and use different programming concepts, such as API endpoints, JSON data, and error handling. Improved my web development and API integration skills. I am proud of what I achieved and I hope you'll find it helpful.
